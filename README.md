# Architecture


This app implements MVVM architecture. App consist of different fragments and 1 root activity. Activity holds a container layout in order to manage fragments which will be controlled by navigation component. Here is the package structure:

Data

Data package should include response models, data source. It shouldn't know any logic.

UI

UI like a feature. It contains Fragments,  and feature related classes like a domains, mappers and ui models. Make sure that all classes here are specific to the this feature. If it is a class that is also used in other features, it should be moved to the common package.

Di

This package may actually be inside the common module. But I prefer to carry outside of core package to be more visible.

Viewmodel

This package includes viewmodels.

Util

This package include utility class that has glide image loading etc.

**Tools that I used** :

- Navigation Component
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Retrofit 
- Room
- Data store preferences
- Coroutines for database
- Livedata
- View Binding
- Glide for image loading
- RESTApi
- LottieAnimationView

**Arhictecture:**

- MVVM
